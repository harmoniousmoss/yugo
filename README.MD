# Yugo - Server Performance Testing Tool
Yugo is load testing solution that helps businesses ensure their websites can handle high traffic conditions. Built with Go and Fiber framework, it simulates thousands of concurrent users to identify performance bottlenecks before they impact real customers. Features automated testing, scalable architecture, and configurable scenarios - helping organizations prevent costly downtime and maintain optimal user experience.
## Features

- **Dynamic Domain Configuration**: Easily update the target domain using a `.env` file.
- **Randomized Requests**: Generate and send requests from a list of 1000 unique paths.
- **High Concurrency**: Utilizes Go's goroutines to simulate real-world load.
- **Performance Insights**: Evaluate server RPS performance and identify bottlenecks.
- **Extensible**: Easily modify for additional HTTP methods, headers, or payloads.

## How It Works

1. **Load Configuration**:
   - The domain is loaded dynamically from the `.env` file.

2. **Path Generation**:
   - A file (`urls.txt`) contains 1000 unique paths (e.g., `/news1.php`, `/api/endpoint`, etc.).
   - Paths are read and randomized for each request.

3. **Concurrency**:
   - Requests are sent concurrently using goroutines, simulating real-world high traffic scenarios.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Measures the time taken to complete all requests, helping determine the server's RPS handling capacity.

## Example `.env` File

```env
DOMAIN=https://example.com
```

## Example `urls.txt`

```txt
/news1.php
/blog/random1.php
/api/data?query=test
/page123.html
/products/item99
```
